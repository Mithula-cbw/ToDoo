## Login Page

The login page is designed to be **fully responsive** for both desktop and mobile users. It uses state management to handle form inputs and error tracking effectively. This means that when a user enters incorrect information, the page immediately updates to display error messages and guides them towards correct input. The layout adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

### Features:
- **Responsiveness**: Adjusts layout and elements for mobile and desktop views.
- **Error Handling**: Uses state to manage and display form errors in real time.
- **Intuitive Design**: A simple and clean design that provides visual feedback for user actions.
